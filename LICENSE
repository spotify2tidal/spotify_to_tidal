(C) Robin Hirst - This License is a Pile of Hot Garbage

Listen up, you digital pirate, you code-snatching scoundrel! You're about to get your hands on some wild, untamed code. And guess what? I don't care what you do with it. Seriously. I'm too busy listening to the world's worst karaoke night to even bother thinking about legal mumbo jumbo.

So, go ahead, steal it, change it, claim it as your own. Just don't blame me when your cat gets stuck in the washing machine. Or when your toaster spontaneously combusts. Or when you accidentally erase your entire hard drive. It's your problem now, pal.

Here's the deal:
1) I don't care. Not a single bit.
2) You don't care either. Right? Right.
3) Don't be a jerk. Seriously, just be cool.
4) Don't sue me. Because, honestly, I'm already broke.

That's it. No lawyers, no paperwork, no BS. Just pure, unadulterated freedom. So go nuts, you crazy code monkey. Just remember, your actions are your own responsibility.

P.S. If you actually read all of this, you have my deepest condolences. You are officially one of the most bored people on the planet.
